How to use Git reflections 1

1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you spot the bug
that was introduced?

It lets you spot any changes made between versions, so if you changed anything
on accident or incorrectly it will be shown.

2) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

So I don't have to go searching through the entire file to see what was changed,
so if I end up not working on something for a while I still can tell what it was
I was doing...

3) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
Docs does?

Manual:     Pro: It won't flood you with things you don't need     Con: You
might forget

Automatically:     Pro: You cannot forget     Con: It will flood you with
unneeded info

4) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file
separately?

Because each is useful for different things.

5) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of
files

...To view the history of files? I'm not sure I understand what is being asked.

6) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Because you know that it is possible to fix whatever you broke.


7) Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git
for?

I know Git is used for storing and sharing files, so I would like to try that.
