4) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git folder to hold the commits in. You need to do it in order to commit changes.

7) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to choose what files are changed in a commit and which aren't. This is useful if you only want one file to change.

12) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can check to make sure you don't have changes all over the place.

15) What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If you have multiple people changing things at the same time, it helps organise things. Branches help with not changing the code for other people while they are working.

20) How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Because the structure isn't linear, the tree-like diagram helps show you what leads to what.
