7) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you're working with other people that aren't on the same computer as you.

10) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not want to stay up to date for some reason.

14) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are copying from one GitHub repository to another new one, clones are copying files to your computer, and branches are so that changes you make don't ruin everything else

22) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If you make a huge mistake and nothing works anymore, you can easily fix it.

25) How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would use a shared document and hope that nobody would mess up something someone else has done
